-- (ExponentPushToken[xxxx]) that the `send-push-notifications` Edge Function
-- sends to Expo's push API when a new notification row is inserted.

-- A user may have multiple devices, so the primary key is the token itself.
-- On sign-out the app deletes the token for that device, and a stale token
-- that Expo rejects is removed on the next send cycle.
