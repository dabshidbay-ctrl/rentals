 * Without this file the router renders its own bare "Unmatched Route" page,
 * which is untranslated, unstyled and offers no way out other than the browser
 * back button. This one names the address that failed and always leaves a route
 * home; "Go back" is only offered when there is history to go back to, since a
 * deep link opened cold has none and a dead button is worse than no button.
