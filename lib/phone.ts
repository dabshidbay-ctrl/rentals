/**
 * Somali phone number normalisation.
 *
 * Somali numbers reach us in every shape a person can type them: "0615551234",
 * "+252 61 555 1234", "252-61-555-1234", "61 555 1234". Rejecting any of those
 * would be wrong, so everything that is not a digit or a leading "+" is thrown
 * away first and only the national significant number is checked.
 *
 * After normalising, the national part must be 7–9 digits and must not start
 * with 0 — that covers mobiles (61x–79x + 7 digits) and the shorter Mogadishu
 * landlines (1 xxxxxx). Deliberately no prefix whitelist: Somali operators add
 * ranges regularly, and a stale list would reject a real, working number.
